## Description

Allows same slug for multiple languages in Polylang.

This plugin is *not* being actively developed. I recommend using [Polylang Pro](https://polylang.pro/) instead as it has this feature and is actively being maintained.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What do I need to do to make this work?
Install the plugin and activate it and that is it. There is no settings page or visable output.
